# 🎛 W1 Hit
### An AI-powered MIDI rhythm generator with Ableton Live integration

**Music is defined as a sound that repeats.**  
**Rhythm shares the same definition and thus is the basis of all music.**

W1 Hit is an AI system for generating expressive single-voice drum patterns. It trains on MIDI rhythms and produces musically coherent variations, fills, and new sequences that can be inserted directly into Ableton Live using a Max for Live device.

Designed for producers, sound designers, and researchers, W1 Hit focuses on controllable generation rather than randomness — allowing users to shape output using parameters such as variation and temperature.

✨ Features

🧠 Train on single-voice MIDI drum patterns  
🎚 Generate new rhythms and variations  
🥁 Velocity-aware output (not just note placement)  
🎛 Parameter-controlled generation  
⚡ Real-time Ableton Live integration  
🎹 MIDI-native workflow (no audio preprocessing)  

🧠 How It Works

W1 Hit trains a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) on quantized MIDI grids representing a single drum voice.
During inference, the model generates new patterns conditioned on:
* training data distribution
* input samples
* user-controlled parameters
This enables musically coherent results suitable for production workflows.

🎛 Use Cases

* Drum pattern generation for producers  
*Creating variations of existing grooves  
*AI-assisted composition tools  
*Symbolic music generation research  
*Max for Live instrument development

```
🛠 Installation
1) Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/david-a-campbell/W1_Hit.git
cd W1_Hit
```
2) Install Python dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(Recommended: use a virtual environment)

### 3) Ableton Live Setup

1. Open Ableton Live  
2. Go to **User Library → Presets → MIDI Effects → Max MIDI Effect**  
3. Drag the all the files from the `Max MIDI Effect` folder into this folder  

🚀 Quick Start
Train a model

Place MIDI files into the training dataset folder (called MIDI) and run:
```
python HitGenerator/hit_generator.py
```
Trained models will be saved in:
```
HitGenerator/Models/
```

Copy your trained model to:
```
Max MIDI Effect/w1_hit_infer/Loader
```

Generate patterns:
Inference is handled by:
```
Max MIDI Effect/w1_hit_infer/inference.py
```
This script loads a trained model and generates MIDI patterns.

Use inside Ableton Live:
1. Insert the Max for Live device on a MIDI track
2. Trigger generation
3. Generated patterns are inserted into the MIDI clip

🎚 Generation Parameters

W1 Hit exposes controllable parameters to shape output:
  * Variation — degree of deviation from input pattern
  * Temperature — randomness vs determinism
  * Fill Depth — density of added notes
These allow producers to dial in results that fit their groove.
